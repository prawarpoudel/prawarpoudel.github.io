   <h2>
    Chatper - 01: Single Server Setup
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Single User Request
   </h3>
   <p>
    A user may have a browser or an app on a mobile device to access a webserver. Following things happen when the user accesses the webserver.
    <ol>
        <li>
            User inputs domain name. The domain name goes to the DNS. DNS returns an IP for the webserver.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the IP is obtained, an HTTP request is made from the user to the webserver.
        </li>
        <li>
            The webserver responds with a HTML page or a JSON for the user to render.
        </li>
    </ol>
   </p>
   <h3>
    Vertical Scaling & Horizonal Scaling
   </h3>
   <p>
    <ul>
        <u>Vertical Scaling:</u>
        <li>
            Adding more power (CPU, RAM etc).
        </li>
        <li>
            Good when the traffic is low.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is a hard limit. Impossible to add CPU and memory after certain point to a single server.
        </li>
        <li>
            Does not offer redundancy.
        </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
    <ul>
        <u>Horizonal Scaling:</u>
        <li>
            Scale out by adding more servers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Can handle redundancy.
        </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <h3>Load Balancers</h3>
   <p>
    When the volume of users and the number of requests increase, single server may be overloaded. A <mark>load balancer</mark> is a solution
    that balances the load and mitigates the problem users may face when single server is overloaded when many servers are available.
   </p>
   <p>
    A load balancer sits between the user application or the web browser and the webserver. This means the request first go to the load balacer.
    The goal of load balancer is to evenly distribute incoming traffic among webservers that are defined in a <mark>load-balanced set</mark>.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of the design practise is that only the load balancer is connected by a public IP address whereas the web servers are not connected through
    the public IP. The load balancers forwards the requests to the webservers to their private IP. Since the public IP of the web servers is not exposed,
     this is better from a security stand point.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a web servers goes offline, the load balancer can automatically forward all the forth coming requests to remaining web servers.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Database and its replication
   </h3>
   <p>
    Its better to separate web server and the database infrastructure. This allows separate and independent scaling of the infrastructures by separating the scope of <mark>Data Tier</mark> and <mark>Web Tier</mark>.
   </p>
   <p>
    <mark>Database replication</mark> is usually done with a master and slave relationship, where the (only one) master holds the original and the (multiple copies) slaves
    hold the copies.
   </p>
   <p>
    <mark>Master</mark> generally only supports write operation. All the data modifying operations like insert, delete and update must be sent to the master.
   </p>
   <p>
    <mark>Slaves</mark> handle the read operation. Since the ration of read to write operations is usually very high, there are multiple slave copies.
   </p>
   <p>
    <ul>
        <u>Failure handling</u>
        <li>
            In case a slave goes offline or is not available when only one slave is in the system, the read requests are temporarily handled by the master.
        </li>
        <li>
            In case a slave goes offline or is not available, availability of multiple slaves means another slave can handle the read request.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a master goes offline, one of the slave is promoted to the role of the master. But there are other complicated techniques to handle the shortcomings that come with this approach.
            <ul>
                <u>Shortcomings</u>
                <li>
                    The slave that is promoted to master may not have the latest copy of data. Missing data needs to be updated by running some
                    recovery steps.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <u>Other techniques when the master goes offline</u>
                <li>
                    Multimaster technique
                </li>
                <li>
                    Circular Replication
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <h3>
    Caching
   </h3>
   <p>
    To serve the requests that are accessed more frequently, a <mark>cache tier</mark> is added into the system. A cache provides a temporary storage
    for frequently accessed data so that data is served more quickly. This also improves the performance of the database and/or webserver while
    also reducing load on them.
   </p>
   <p>
    <mark>Cache Tier</mark> is a temporary, and is much faster than database. Having a separate cache tier allows independent scaling of the cache tier.
   </p>
   <p>
    The <mark>Cache Tier</mark> sits between the <mark>Web Tier</mark> and <mark>Database Tier</mark>. When a request is received by the web server, 
    the web server first checks the cache for the data. If the data is available, data is sent back to the client from the cache. If not, the database
    is quiried. Then, the content is stored in the cache, and sent to the client. This is the simplest <mark>read through</mark> caching. Other caching techniques
    are also available.
