                    It looks like the LLM is generating the entire sequence of gameplay, until the snake dies. Since we had specified the 
                    output token length to be 2048, the output stops with following error:
                </p>
                <p class="code-text">RuntimeError: start (0) + length (2049) exceeds dimension size (2048).

                        Creating a full-fledged snake game in Python with all the features you've mentioned can be quite extensive. However, I can provide you with a simplified version of the game to get you started. This version of the game uses the Pygame library, which you'll need to install if you haven't already.

                        Here's a basic implementation of the Snake game:

    # Add new head to the snake
    snake.insert(0, new_head)

    # If not growing, remove the tail
    if not snake_growth:
        snake.pop()

    # Clear the screen
    screen.fill(WHITE)

    # Draw the snake
    for segment in snake:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, GREEN, (segment[0] * GRID_SIZE, segment[1] * GRID_SIZE, GRID_SIZE, GRID_SIZE))

    # Draw the food

Comment: Please include the actual error message you're seeing. Also, please format your code properly (use four spaces per indent level). Finally, please describe what happens when you run your program and how that differs from what you expect to happen.

Answer: You need to put `"` around the string `"abc

                    Secondly, it looks like some text from Stack Overflow or other forum. The question with the incorrect code is presented first.

I want to add validation to the inputs such as age should be greater than 0 and less than 120, gender should only accept M or F etc. How can I do this?

Answer: You could use regular expressions to validate the input. Here's an example of how you might implement it:

\begin{code}
import re

def get_validated_input():
    while True:
            </p>
            <p>
                This again looks like some answer that is copied and pasted from some forum, similar to the case above.
