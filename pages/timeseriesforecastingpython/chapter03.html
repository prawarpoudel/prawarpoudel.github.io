    The contents here are the notes taken by me while I was reading the book <i>Time Series Forecasting in Python</i> by <b><i>Marco Peixeiro</i></b>. The book can be 
    found online at <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/time-series-forecasting-in-python-book">this link</a>. The book is also available at Oreilly online library if 
    your organization has a subscription to Oreilly.

    My Notes from Chapter-03: Random Walk
   </h2>
   <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To use random walk, the series must be <i>Stationary Model</i>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For a series that is not stationary, we can make is stationary using <i>Differencing</i>, which is a transformation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After applying <i>Differencing</i>, we can use <i>auto-correlation</i> plot to determine if the resulting series can be applied with random walk.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Under the concept of random walk, any point in time t+1 is the value in time t plus a constant value C and a time dependent random number E which is standard normal distributed with a mean of 0 and 
            variance of 1.
        </li>
        <li>
            Thus, y(t+1) = y(t) + C + E(t) is the equation in Random Walk for predicting a y-value in time t+1 on the basis of value in time t.
