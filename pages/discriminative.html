    ,
            following are the major points to take away:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Machine Learning models can be classified into two categories: (a) Discriminative, and (b) Generative
     </li>
     <li>
      Discriminative model tries to draw boundaries in the data space whereas Generative model tries to model how the data is placed/distributed.
     </li>
     <hr/>
     <li>
      <mark>
       Discriminative Models:
      </mark>
      <ul>
       <li>
        use (conditional) probability to discriminate the datasets.
       </li>
       <li>
        Data sets can be unseen.
       </li>
       <li>
        Used to make predictions, and used for classification and regression problems.
       </li>
       <li>
        unable to generate new data points, since they are focused only on generating boundaries
       </li>
       <li>
        mostly used for supervised learning tasks
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      <mark>
       Generative Models:
      </mark>
      <ul>
       <li>
        focuses on the distribution of datasets
       </li>
       <li>
        to find the probability
       </li>
       <li>
        they are able to generate new data points similar to training datasets since they capture the distribution of the dataset
       </li>
       <li>
        mostly suited for unsupervised learning tasks
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <hr/>
     <li>
      Presents an example of spam email filtering using the two methods
     </li>
     <li>
      <mark>
       Discriminative Models:
      </mark>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Tries to define the
        <mark>
         boundary
        </mark>
        condition of what defines the spam vs not spam email, using training datasets
       </li>
       <li>
        i.e. somehow find the P(Y|X), Y being probability of email being spam, X being words in the email.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      <mark>
       Generative Models:
      </mark>
      <ul>
       <li>
        derives the conditional probability that P(X|Y) and P(Y) from general observation or training datasets
       </li>
       <li>
        uses
        <mark>
         Bayes Theorem
        </mark>
        to calculate P(Y|X) after P(X|Y) and P(Y) is estimated
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <hr/>
     <li>
      Some more points on each
     </li>
     <li>
      <mark>
       Discriminative Models:
      </mark>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Some of the popular examples are:
        <ul>
         <li>
          Logistic regression, SVMs, NNs, Nearest Neighbour, Desicion Trees, Random Forests etc
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        Impacted negligibly by outlier.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      <mark>
       Generative Models:
      </mark>
      <ul>
       <li>
        they often rely on Bayes Theorem, so they can solve complex tasks than analgous discriminative model
       </li>
       <li>
        Examples are:
        <ul>
         <li>
          Naiive Bayes, Bayesian Network, Markov Random fields, Hidden Markov Model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Generative Adversarial Networks, Autoregressive Model
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        Impacted highly by any outlier.
       </li>
      </ul>

    , following are the major take aways:
    <ul>
     <li>
      They present an exmaple of topper twins, who are both toppers in their class. But, they have a different approach to preparing for tests.
     </li>
     <li>
      The first one
      <ul>
       <li>
        goes into detail of each topic,
       </li>
       <li>
        once he grasps, never forgets it
       </li>
       <li>
        but the process is cumbersome, and needs more time to prepare
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      The second one
      <ul>
       <li>
        gets a general idea about any topic
       </li>
       <li>
        learns the differences and patterns of each subtopics,
       </li>
       <li>
        has more flexibility in thinking
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Here the first is analogous to Generative Modeling while the second one is analogous to Discriminative modeling.
     </li>
     <li>
      Deep Learning algo like ANN, CNN, RNN use Discriminative approach.
     </li>
     <li>
      Deep Learning algo like autoencoder, Botlzmann machine, self organizing maps use Generative approach
     </li>
    </ul>

    Having read through the above topics and after creating a faint idea, the google developer page was a very good source to learn. It can be found at
